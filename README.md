<h1>Soil & Crop Recommendation System</h1>h1.

Overview

This project is a Soil & Crop Recommendation System that uses machine learning to predict soil types from images and recommend suitable crops based on the predicted soil type, season, and water availability. Additionally, it provides smart irrigation suggestions and basic crop disease detection.

Features

Soil Type Prediction: Uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify soil images into different soil types.

Crop Recommendations: Suggests suitable crops based on soil type and season.

Soil Moisture Simulation: Provides simulated moisture levels to guide irrigation decisions.

Smart Irrigation System: Recommends whether to increase or decrease water supply based on soil moisture and water availability.

Crop Disease Detection (Simulated): Provides a basic assessment of potential crop diseases.

Community Crop Sharing: Users can upload crop images and share their farming experiences.

Analytics Dashboard: Displays historical soil and crop data, along with a moisture level trend chart.

Technologies Used

Python

Streamlit (for UI development)

TensorFlow/Keras (for soil type prediction)

OpenCV & PIL (for image processing)

NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)

Matplotlib & Streamlit Charts (for visualization)

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7) along with the necessary dependencies.

Steps

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/soil-crop-recommendation.git
cd soil-crop-recommendation

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application

streamlit run app.py

Usage

Upload a soil image.

Click "Predict Soil Type" to classify the soil.

Adjust water availability using the slider.

Select the current season to get crop recommendations.

View soil moisture levels and smart irrigation suggestions.

Check for any simulated crop diseases.

Optionally, share your farming experience with the community.

Model Details

The soil classification model is a deep learning model trained using TensorFlow/Keras.

It predicts one of the following soil types:

Alluvial Soil

Black Soil

Clay Soil

Red Soil

Future Enhancements

Improve the soil classification model with more training data.

Integrate real-time soil moisture sensors.

Implement an advanced crop disease detection model.

Expand crop recommendation data with yield optimization suggestions.
